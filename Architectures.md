A **DBMS architecture** defines how users interact with the database to read, write, or update information.  
A well-designed architecture and schema (a blueprint detailing tables, fields, and relationships) ensure **data consistency**, **improved performance**, and **data security**.

## Types of DBMS Architecture

- **1-Tier Architecture**
- **2-Tier Architecture**
- **3-Tier Architecture**

## 1-Tier Architecture

In **1-Tier Architecture**, the user works directly with the database on the same system.  
The **client, server, and database** are all in one application.  

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** Microsoft Excel â€” where user interface, logic, and data storage all happen on the same device.

### Features
- Simple and ideal for **personal or standalone applications**.
- No network or external server needed.

### Advantages
- **Simple Architecture** â€“ only one machine required.  
- **Cost-Effective** â€“ no extra hardware needed.  
- **Easy to Implement** â€“ quick to deploy, useful for small projects.  

### Disadvantages
- **Limited to Single User** â€“ not designed for multi-user access.  
- **Poor Security** â€“ if system is compromised, both app and data are exposed.  
- **No Centralized Control** â€“ data stored locally, harder to back up/manage.  
- **Hard to Share Data** â€“ data sharing is difficult.

## 2-Tier Architecture

In **2-Tier Architecture**, the client application directly communicates with the database server.  
APIs like **ODBC** and **JDBC** are commonly used.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A **Library Management System** in schools or small organizations.

### Structure
- **Client Layer (Tier 1):** User interface and application programs (e.g., search books, issue books).  
- **Database Layer (Tier 2):** Database server storing all records (e.g., book details, user info).  

The client sends a request â†’ database processes â†’ result returned to client.

### Advantages
- **Easy Access** â€“ faster data retrieval.  
- **Scalable** â€“ can add more clients or upgrade hardware.  
- **Low Cost** â€“ cheaper than 3-Tier.  
- **Easy Deployment** â€“ straightforward setup.  
- **Simple** â€“ easy to understand with only two layers.  

### Disadvantages
- **Limited Scalability** â€“ server overload with many users.  
- **Security Issues** â€“ direct DB connections are vulnerable.  
- **Tight Coupling** â€“ client and server are closely linked.  
- **Difficult Maintenance** â€“ harder with more users/systems.

## 3-Tier Architecture

In **3-Tier Architecture**, an **application server** sits between the client and database server.  
The client never directly communicates with the database.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** **E-commerce Store**
- **User:** Browses and adds products to cart.  
- **Processing Layer:** Business logic (stock check, pricing, discounts).  
- **Database Layer:** Stores product info, cart, and order history.  

### Advantages
- **Enhanced Scalability** â€“ distributed deployment of application servers.  
- **Data Integrity** â€“ middle layer prevents data corruption.  
- **Better Security** â€“ prevents direct database access.  

### Disadvantages
- **More Complex** â€“ harder to design and manage.  
- **Slower Response Time** â€“ extra communication layer.  
- **Higher Cost** â€“ more hardware, software, and skilled staff required.
